# Signal Corps Engagement Log

**Purpose:** Complete record of all external posts, threads, articles, and community interactions produced during the Oracle Forge sprint (Weeks 8–9). Updated daily by Signal Corps. Presented at each mob session. This is a deliverable — not a post-mortem.

**Instructions:** Add a row for every post, comment, or community interaction the day it goes live. Do not batch. Include the link immediately — if a link is not available yet, mark as `[PENDING]` and update within 24 hours.

### Community Intelligence

| Date | Source | Finding | Action taken |
|------|--------|---------|--------------|
| Apr 10 | X reply | Engineer noted that dialect translation debt compounds fast when teams pick specialized DBs per use case — agents inherit silo decisions with no context of why the split exists | suggested action is provided to both IOs and Drivers as per the finding |
| Apr 11 | r/MachineLearning comment | Developer questioning pass@k as a meaningful metric — building Bayesian benchmarking alternative (bayesbench). Key insight: systematic failures (0% across all trials) can't be resolved by more sampling — supports DAB's finding that bottleneck is planning not variance | suggested action is provided to both IOs and Drivers as per the finding
| Apr 14 | r/LocalLLaMA comment 1 | Another team building against DAB using resolver utility + result set size validation to catch silent join failures. Also wiring LLM-based extraction pipeline for unstructured fields — believes patents 0% is fixable with this approach | Bring to mob session — validate our join key resolver design against theirs. Ask IOs to document result set validation in KB v2 |
| Apr 14 | r/LocalLLaMA comment 2 | Developer noted baseline DAB agents had no live schema relationship tool — were planning blind from natural language descriptions. Agents spending ~20% on exploration still couldn't see table relationships | Bring to mob session — schema introspection before planning is a confirmed gap. Drivers should prioritise this in agent design |

Bring both to mob session:
