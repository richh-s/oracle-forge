# CHANGELOG — kb/corrections/

All structural changes to the corrections log are recorded here.
Note: individual failure entries are logged directly in corrections_log.md —
this CHANGELOG tracks changes to the log's structure, format, or bulk operations
(e.g. promoting entries to domain KB documents, archiving resolved entries).

Format: `[DATE] | [CHANGE TYPE] | [WHAT CHANGED] | [REASON]`
Change types: STRUCTURE-CHANGE | PROMOTED | BULK-REVIEW | FORMAT-UPDATE

## 2026-04-08

| Date | Change Type | What Changed | Reason |
|------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| 2026-04-08 | STRUCTURE-CHANGE | `corrections_log.md` created with columns: ID, Date, Query, Failure Category, What Was Expected, What Agent Returned, Fix Applied, Post-Fix Score. Example row COR-001 added (multi-database routing failure on support ticket query). | Required KB v3 deliverable. Self-learning loop requires a structured log the agent reads at session start. |

## Instructions for Future Entries

**What belongs in this CHANGELOG vs corrections_log.md:**
- Individual agent failures → go directly into `corrections_log.md` (Drivers add these after every observed failure).
- Structural changes to the log format, bulk promotions of entries to domain KB docs, or periodic reviews → go here.

**Promotion process:** When a correction entry reveals a pattern (the same failure type appears 3+ times), Intelligence Officers should promote it:
1. Extract the pattern into the relevant `kb/domain/` or `kb/architecture/` document.
2. Add a PROMOTED row here referencing the COR IDs that were promoted and the destination document.
3. The original COR entries remain in `corrections_log.md` — they are never deleted.

**Bulk review:** At the end of each week, Intelligence Officers review all new COR entries and determine which should be promoted. Log the review outcome here even if no promotions occurred.

| Review Date | COR IDs Reviewed | Promoted | Destination | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|-------------|-------|
| 2026-04-08 | COR-001 | No | — | Single entry, pattern not yet established. Monitor for recurrence. |
