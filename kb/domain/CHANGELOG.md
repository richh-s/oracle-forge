## 2026-04-08

| Date | Document | Change Type | What Changed | Reason |
|------|----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| 2026-04-08 | `yelp_schema.md` | ADDED | Initial document created. Covers inferred PostgreSQL tables (business, review, user), MongoDB collections, known user_id join key mismatch, unstructured review.text field. Marked as requiring Driver verification after dataset load. | Yelp is the recommended DAB starting dataset. Schema must exist before first agent query. |
| 2026-04-08 | `join_keys_glossary.md` | ADDED | Initial document created. Covers Yelp user_id integer→string mismatch, general rules for zero-padding and ObjectId fields. Marked as requiring confirmation by inspection. | Required KB v2 deliverable. Needed before any cross-database join is attempted. |
| 2026-04-08 | `unstructured_fields_inventory.md` | ADDED | Initial document created. Covers review.text (sentiment/topic extraction) and business.categories (comma-separated string requiring split). | Required KB v2 deliverable. Needed before any query involving free-text fields. |
| 2026-04-08 | `domain_terms.md` | ADDED | Initial document created. Defines: active business, high-rated business, recent review, repeat customer (Yelp); churn, active account, fiscal quarter (cross-dataset). | Required KB v2 deliverable. Prevents domain knowledge gap failures (DAB Failure Category 4). |

## Instructions for Future Entries

- Every time Drivers load a new DAB dataset and inspect its schema, update `yelp_schema.md` (or add a new schema doc) and log the update here with the confirmed field names and types.
- Every time a new join key mismatch is confirmed by inspection, add it to `join_keys_glossary.md`, update `utils/join_key_resolver.py FORMAT_REGISTRY`, and log here.
- Every time a new domain term is discovered through a probe failure, add it to `domain_terms.md` and log here with the probe ID that surfaced it.
- Every time a document is updated because a Driver found the existing entry was wrong, add an UPDATED row and note what was incorrect.
