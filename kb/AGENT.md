# Oracle Forge Agent — Memory Index
## Load this file at the start of every session.

> This is the MEMORY.md equivalent for Oracle Forge.
> It tells you what knowledge exists and when to load each file.
> Do not load all files at once. Load only what the current query requires.

## Critical Rules (Always Active)

1. After every cross-database join: check row count. Zero rows = key format mismatch.
2. For patents dataset: use dateutil.parser for dates, NOT regex.
3. For crmarenapro: TRIM() all ID fields before joining (25% have trailing spaces).
4. For bookreview: strip bid_/bref_ prefixes before joining book_id to purchase_id.
5. For stockmarket/stockindex: use adj_close, not close, for price comparisons.
6. Word boundaries in regex: use \bWORD\b not WORD (MALE matches inside FEMALE).
7. Run queries to different databases in parallel, not sequentially.
8. Spend ~20% of tool calls on exploration (list_db, sample queries) before analytical queries.
9. SQL output: return raw SQL only — never wrap in code fences, never prepend explanation text. If you cannot answer, return `SELECT NULL AS reason`. (Pattern A — 9 failures in corrections log)
10. MongoDB pipeline output: the first character must be `[` — return a raw JSON array, never a quoted string or code fence. If the pipeline arrives as a string, strip quotes and json.loads() before passing to PyMongo. (Pattern B — 12 failures in corrections log)
11. DuckDB contains ONLY 3 tables: `review`, `tip`, `user`. There is NO `business` table in DuckDB. Any query involving business data (name, city, stars, categories, hours, attributes) MUST route to MongoDB, not DuckDB. Never generate DuckDB SQL that references or joins `business`.
12. DuckDB date column has two inconsistent formats: `'August 01, 2016 at 03:44 AM'` and `'29 May 2013, 23:01'`. Never use direct string comparison or BETWEEN for dates in DuckDB. Always parse using COALESCE across both strptime patterns: `COALESCE(TRY_STRPTIME(date_col, '%B %d, %Y at %I:%M %p'), TRY_STRPTIME(date_col, '%d %B %Y, %H:%M'))`.
