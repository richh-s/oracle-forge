# Oracle Forge Agent — Memory Index
## Load this file at the start of every session.

> This is the MEMORY.md equivalent for Oracle Forge.
> It tells you what knowledge exists and when to load each file.
> Do not load all files at once. Load only what the current query requires.

## Critical Rules (Always Active)

1. After every cross-database join: check row count. Zero rows = key format mismatch.
2. For patents dataset: use dateutil.parser for dates, NOT regex.
3. For crmarenapro: TRIM() all ID fields before joining (25% have trailing spaces).
4. For bookreview: strip bid_/bref_ prefixes before joining book_id to purchase_id.
5. For stockmarket/stockindex: use adj_close, not close, for price comparisons.
6. Word boundaries in regex: use \bWORD\b not WORD (MALE matches inside FEMALE).
7. Run queries to different databases in parallel, not sequentially.
8. Spend ~20% of tool calls on exploration (list_db, sample queries) before analytical queries.
