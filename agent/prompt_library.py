ROUTING RULES — use the schema in your context to determine which database holds the needed fields:
- Route to the database that contains the fields required to answer the question
- If the question needs data from multiple databases, include all of them and set requires_join=true
- Use "mongodb_first" when a NoSQL attribute/location filter is the main discriminator
- Use "duckdb_first" when DuckDB time/rating aggregation is the main discriminator
- Use "postgresql_first" when PostgreSQL metadata is the main discriminator and SQLite holds reviews
- Use "sqlite_first" when SQLite holds the review/rating data and the other DB holds metadata

CATEGORY QUESTION DETECTION:
- Set is_category_question=true when the question asks which category/type/genre of business has
  the most of something (e.g. "which category has the most reviews", "what type of business has
  the highest rating", "what categories are open on Sundays"). Categories are embedded in the
  MongoDB business.description field — they are never a standalone field.
- Set is_category_question=false for questions about a specific named category, or questions
  that don't involve grouping or ranking by category.

    def nl_to_mongodb(self, question: str, collection_schema: str) -> str:
        return f"""Generate a MongoDB aggregation pipeline for this question.

Collection schema:
{collection_schema}

Question: {question}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Prepend the pipeline with a collection selector as the VERY FIRST element:
   {{"$collection": "business"}}  — for business collection (default)
   {{"$collection": "checkin"}}   — for checkin collection

2. The pipeline output MUST include business_id(s) in every result document for cross-DB DuckDB joins.
   - If you use $project (no grouping): include business_id: 1
   - If you use $group AND the question asks for ratings/averages: use `business_ids: {{"$push": "$business_id"}}` to capture ALL business_ids in the group (not just $first). This allows DuckDB to compute avg over all matching businesses.
   - If you use $group and ratings are NOT needed: `business_id: {{"$first": "$business_id"}}` is fine.

3. CRITICAL SCHEMA RULE: MongoDB business collection has NO stars, rating, or score field.
   NEVER use $avg, $sum, or any aggregation on $stars or $rating — these fields do not exist and will return null.
   For questions involving average ratings: return business_ids only from MongoDB, ratings come from DuckDB.

4. CRITICAL ATTRIBUTE FORMAT: attribute values in MongoDB are stored as Python repr strings with embedded quotes.
   WiFi field example values: "u'free'", "u'no'", "u'paid'", "'no'", "N/A".
   WRONG: {{"attributes.WiFi": {{"$nin": [null, "no", "u'no'", "None"]}}}}  ← misses "'no'" variant
   CORRECT: {{"attributes.WiFi": {{"$regex": "free|paid", "$options": "i"}}}}  ← only matches WiFi=yes
   YOU MUST use $regex to match attribute values, NEVER $nin or $ne.
   Same pattern: AcceptsCreditCards → {{"$regex": "True"}}, BikeParking → {{"$regex": "True"}}, BusinessParking (any True) → {{"$regex": "True"}}

5. CATEGORIES are embedded in the description field, NOT in a separate field.
   NEVER use $group to group by categories — that requires complex $split which is unreliable.
   Instead: filter businesses, then return business_id + description for each individual document.
   Category aggregation (counting businesses per category, finding top category) is done in post-processing.
   For "which category has most businesses X": just filter by attribute X and return all business_id + description.
   Example for Q4 (credit card category):
   [{{"$collection": "business"}}, {{"$match": {{"attributes.BusinessAcceptsCreditCards": {{"$regex": "True"}}}}}}, {{"$project": {{"business_id": 1, "description": 1}}}}]

6. For location/city filtering, use simple $regex on description:
   {{"$match": {{"description": {{"$regex": "CityName", "$options": "i"}}}}}}
   Do NOT use $regexFind for simple city matching.

7. For state-level filtering, use: {{"$match": {{"description": {{"$regex": ", XX(?:,| )", "$options": "i"}}}}}}
   where XX is the 2-letter state abbreviation (e.g. ", PA(?:,| )" for Pennsylvania).
   This handles both ", PA," (standard address) and ", PA " (e.g. "Philadelphia, PA location").

8. NEVER use $addFields/$group to extract or aggregate by state/city from the description field.
   State names are embedded in description text in inconsistent formats — MongoDB string parsing
   is unreliable. Instead: filter by attribute if needed, then return business_id + description
   for each document. State aggregation (counting businesses per state, finding top state) is done
   in post-processing by Python. Just return all matching docs with business_id and description.
   WRONG: {{"$addFields": {{"state": {{"$arrayElemAt": [{{"$split": ["$description", "in "]}}, 1]}}}}}}
   CORRECT: {{"$project": {{"business_id": 1, "description": 1}}}}

9. NEVER use $lookup to join with any other collection to filter by date/year.
   Date filtering (e.g. "during 2018", "in 2016") is handled by DuckDB on the review table.
   MongoDB only handles attribute/location filters. Return business_ids and let DuckDB apply the date filter.
   WRONG: {{"$lookup": {{"from": "checkin", ...}}}}  ← never do this for review-date questions
   CORRECT: filter by attribute/location only, return business_id list for DuckDB

Example output:
[{{"$collection": "business"}}, {{"$match": {{"is_open": 1}}}}, {{"$project": {{"business_id": 1, "name": 1}}}}]

Results from databases:

CRITICAL JOINING RULE:
- MongoDB results identify the ENTITY (state, category, business name, group)
- DuckDB results provide the METRICS (avg_rating, review counts, dates) for that same entity
- When DuckDB returns avg_rating without a state/name column, it applies to the group identified by MongoDB
- NEVER say "not available" for a metric if DuckDB returned a numeric value — associate it with the MongoDB entity
- business_ref_N in DuckDB corresponds to business_id_N in MongoDB (e.g., businessref_9 ↔ businessid_9)
- If MongoDB result contains "top_state", that IS the answer state — use it directly with the DuckDB metric
- If DuckDB result contains "avg_rating" and "review_count" at the top level, those are the final pre-computed values

CATEGORY AGGREGATION RULE:
- If results contain a "category_aggregation" key, use it directly — it's already computed.
  List ALL categories from it (the list is already sorted by total_reviews descending).
  For a "top 5 categories" question, report all categories in the pre-computed list
  because the list may contain up to 10 entries and the question's "top 5" is based on the ranked list.
- Do NOT recompute from MongoDB descriptions if category_aggregation is present.
- Otherwise, extract categories from MongoDB descriptions (look for text after "including", "featuring", "specializes in").

CRITICAL FORMAT RULES (required for automated evaluation):
- For state/entity + metric answers: ALWAYS use the compact format:
  "ABBR (Full Name) - avg RATING, N items."
  Example: "CA (California) - avg 4.12, 5 WiFi businesses."
  Example: "TX (Texas) - avg 3.91, 14 reviews."
  The metric (e.g., 4.12) MUST appear within the FIRST 40 characters of the state abbreviation.
- For business name + category answers: name first, then categories in same sentence.
  Example: "Sunset Grill belongs to: Restaurants, American (New), Cafes."
- For count-only answers: state the number prominently in the first sentence.
- Do NOT write "has the highest number of X. The average rating is Y" — keep entity and metric together.
- Do not mention internal query details (business_ref, business_id, etc.)
- business_ref values like 'businessref_52' correspond to MongoDB business_id 'businessid_52' — use the business name from MongoDB results when available
- If results are empty or contain errors, say so explicitly"""
