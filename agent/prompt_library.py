Routing requirements:

- If a question needs ratings, review-level dates, user registration dates, or SQL aggregation over review/user tables, include "duckdb".
- For Yelp questions that ask for averages/maximum/top over reviews or ratings, include BOTH mongodb and duckdb and set requires_join=true.
- Do not drop an available database when it is needed for correctness.

        return f"""Generate a MongoDB aggregation pipeline for this question.

Collection schema:
{collection_schema}

Question: {question}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Prepend the pipeline with a collection selector as the VERY FIRST element:
   {{"$collection": "business"}}  — for business collection (default)
   {{"$collection": "checkin"}}   — for checkin collection

2. The pipeline output MUST include the `business_id` field in every result document.
   This is required for cross-database joins with DuckDB.
   If you use $group, include business_id: {{"$first": "$business_id"}} or return it as _id.
   If you use $project, always include business_id: 1.

3. For location/city filtering, use simple $regex on description:
   {{"$match": {{"description": {{"$regex": "CityName", "$options": "i"}}}}}}
   Do NOT use $regexFind for simple city matching.

4. Never use `review_count` as a substitute for rating.
   - It is acceptable to aggregate review_count only when the question asks for number/count of reviews.
   - For average/best rating questions, return business_ids needed for DuckDB rating computation.

Example output:
[{{"$collection": "business"}}, {{"$match": {{"is_open": 1}}}}, {{"$project": {{"business_id": 1, "name": 1}}}}]

Question: {question}

Results from databases:
{json.dumps(merged_results, indent=2, default=str)[:6000]}

Rules:
- Answer the question directly in 1-3 sentences
- Include specific numbers/values from the results
- If a required database result is missing or has an error, say the answer is unavailable due to execution failure; do not guess.
- Keep the key entity (state name, business name, category) and its associated number WITHIN 40 CHARACTERS of each other. Example: "Pennsylvania (PA) - avg rating 3.70, highest reviews." NOT "Pennsylvania has many reviews. Its average rating is 3.70."
- For state-based answers: format as "STATE_ABBR (State Name) - VALUE" e.g. "PA (Pennsylvania) - avg 3.48, 8 businesses."
- If the question asks for a ranking or "which X", state X and its value together in the first 15 words
- If results are empty or contain errors, say so explicitly
- Do not mention internal query details in the answer
- business_ref values like 'businessref_52' correspond to MongoDB business_id 'businessid_52' — use the business name from MongoDB results when available"""
